## IRS Exercises TDS Option Year: TDS to Continue Research Advancing Unanchored Graph Search and Further Development of the Knowledge Graph API (KGAPI) User-Facing Tool.  
In recent years, IRS Research, Applied Analytics, and Statistics (RAAS) is increasingly creating graph data models to facilitate fast, efficient queries and visualization of complex relationships between people, places, and things.  Using the KGAPI tool (designed and built through TDS prime contract), RAAS supports business customers in providing data driven insights to understand taxpayer behavior and make better informed decisions about service and enforcement.  The KGAPI tool is built on top of Neo4J technology to explore and understand knowledge graph data.

1910.0362 [WalkRNN: Reading Stories From Property Graphs](http://viXra.org/abs/1910.0362)

Abstract: WalkRNN, the approach described herein, leverages research in learning continuous representations
for nodes in networks, layers in features captured in property graph attributes and labels, and uses
Deep Learning language modeling via Recurrent Neural Networks to read the grammar of an enriched
property graph. We then demonstrate translating this learned graph literacy into actionable knowledge
through graph classification tasks.

1907.11623 [Node Alertness-Detecting changes in rapidly evolving graphs - arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11623)

Abstract: In this article we describe a new approach for detecting changes in rapidly evolving large-scale graphs. 
The key notion involved is local alertness: nodes monitor change within their neighborhoods at each time step. 
Here we propose a financial local alertness application for cointegrated stock pairs

## TDS Providing A Solution For The Research, Applied Analytics and Statistics Division at the IRS using Graph Analytics
## Nov 28, 2018
Tylor Data Services, LLC, a firm specializing in advanced graph analytics, deep learning and data science (www.tylordata.com) is working with the IRS’s Research, Applied Analytics & Statistics (RAAS) Data Exploration & Testing (DET) division to develop Knowledge Graph tools to enable graph analytics and help further the IRS mission.  

TDS’ graph analytics solution builds on a Knowledge Graph environment and provides tools to enable end-users to search for graph patterns and examine data results.  The project goals include exploration of emerging techniques in graph analytics and graph computational models, and applications of GPU and distributed frameworks. TDS was awarded an 8(a) sole source contract with one base year and two option years.
