1910.0362 [WalkRNN: Reading Stories From Property Graphs](http://viXra.org/abs/1910.0362)

Abstract: WalkRNN, the approach described herein, leverages research in learning continuous representations
for nodes in networks, layers in features captured in property graph attributes and labels, and uses
Deep Learning language modeling via Recurrent Neural Networks to read the grammar of an enriched
property graph. We then demonstrate translating this learned graph literacy into actionable knowledge
through graph classification tasks.

1907.11623 [Node Alertness-Detecting changes in rapidly evolving graphs - arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11623)

Abstract: In this article we describe a new approach for detecting changes in rapidly evolving large-scale graphs. 
The key notion involved is local alertness: nodes monitor change within their neighborhoods at each time step. 
Here we propose a financial local alertness application for cointegrated stock pairs

## TDS Providing A Solution For The Research, Applied Analytics and Statistics Division at the IRS using Graph Analytics
