[This notebook](https://github.com/dtylor/dtylor.github.io/blob/master/novelapproach.ipynb) Applying Deep Learning to graph analysis is an emerging field that is yielding promising results. Our approach [WalkRNN](https://github.com/dtylor/WalkRNN) described below leverages research in learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks, layers in features captured in property graph attributes and labels, and uses Deep Learning language modeling to train the computer to read the ‘story’ of a graph. The computer can then translate this learned graph literacy into actionable knowledge such as graph classification tasks.
